<h1>Overview</h1>
	Dotify is a database-driven startup music streaming service currently serving over 100 customers with a catalog of over 1000 songs. We have been commissioned to handle the database administration system capable of tracking song streams of over 10,000 streams annually and allowing users to create up to 5 personal playlists of songs each up to 100 songs long. Customers may choose to create their own playlists to share with friends and family.  Dotify is a free service but offers customers the option to subscribe to a premium tier to remove ads.
